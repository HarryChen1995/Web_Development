                          <p class="timeline__content-desc">$At the age of 16
                            I left China for summer camp for two-month student exchange program in America. I flew 23 hours across Europe and the Atlantic Ocean to Orono, Maine. Where I took my first steps onto American soil. I was in culture shock from what I had seen back home to what you see in reality. Everything from food, people, and media all differed from my culture back home. I had to adjust but, still keep some of my Chinese culture also.</p>

                      <p class="timeline__content-desc">$A year after, I officially attended Orono High School in Maine . I lived at an on-campus dorm by myself and visited with my host family every weekend. I had a lot of free time compared to school back home. My host family invited me to go Ice fishing during the winter and go tubing on the lake in the summer. I participated in cross country and tennis while in highschool. Lobster and Blueberries were amazing we donâ€™t have either back home city in China.</p>

                      <p class="timeline__content-desc">$I transitioned from green pine trees and cold winters of Maine into the hot and sunny, cactus filled desserts of Arizona for my first college experience as a freshman at the University of Arizona. At first I was in culture shocked at how the landscape and people differed from one state to the next, but I ended up meeting my first two friends and roommates KJ and Mandy. I started studying Optical Science for the first 2 years of college, until I desired and changed my career path to become an electrical computer engineer (ECE) the last 2 years for my bachelors. While at UA I met Jero and Adam and are my best friends to this day.</p>
